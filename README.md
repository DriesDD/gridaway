# gridaway

This is actually both the gridaway and the 'in style' becode exercise.
I used a component-first css framework (Bulma) for the first exercise, and a utility-first css framework (Tailwind) for the second exercise. 
Since Tailwind is very customizable I didn't have to add any pure css and I'm quite proud of it.
However, Bulma was much faster to create elements with so it was a better fit for the first exercise.
